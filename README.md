## ‚öíÔ∏è Installation
To install this framework, you might import it via Maven or Gradle. For maven, just paste this piece of code inside of the
dependencies section:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.lory24</groupId>
  <artifactId>mpu-framework</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

If you're using gradle, paste this:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.lory24:mpu-framework:1.0.2'
```

Otherwise, you have to download the package .jar file and import it manually (unrecommended).

> [!CAUTION]
> In order to include the Gradle or Maven dependency, you'll need to add the GitHub repository as shown in the 
> [Official Guide for Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry) 
> or [Official Guide for Gradle](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry).
